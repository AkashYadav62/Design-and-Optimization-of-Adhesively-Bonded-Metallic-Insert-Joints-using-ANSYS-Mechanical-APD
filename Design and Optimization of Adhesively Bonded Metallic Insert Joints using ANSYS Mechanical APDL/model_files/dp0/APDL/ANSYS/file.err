 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      13.297   TIME= 17:06:05
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.250   TIME= 17:06:13
 Volume 1 is being meshed entirely with SOLID185 tetrahedra, which can   
 be much less accurate than bricks.  Use quadratic (10-node) tetrahedra  
 if available.                                                           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      17.000   TIME= 17:07:58
 A duplicate degree of freedom label (VELX) was found on the D command.  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      17.094   TIME= 17:07:59
 A duplicate degree of freedom label (VELY) was found on the D command.  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      22.344   TIME= 17:10:56
 Meshes made up of 10 percent or more of SOLID185 tetrahedra are not     
 recommended.                                                            

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      22.578   TIME= 17:10:58
 Isotropic material 1 has a value of Poisson's ratio of 1 which must be  
 greater than -1.0 and less than 0.5 and is therefore not valid for      
 isotropic materials.                                                    

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      22.953   TIME= 17:11:23
 The step data was checked and there were errors found.                  
  Please check output or errors file ( F:\4th year\8th                   
 Semester\Project-final year\model_files\dp0\APDL\ANSYS\file.err ) for

 Volume 1 is being meshed entirely with SOLID185 tetrahedra, which can   
 be much less accurate than bricks.  Use quadratic (10-node) tetrahedra  
 if available.

 Meshes made up of 10 percent or more of SOLID185 tetrahedra are not     
 recommended.
